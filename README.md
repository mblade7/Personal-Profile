This is a simple profile page made for Code Louisville's Web Development 1 class. The goal is to complete an aesthetically pleasing personal profile that briefly describes me.
The requirements that were obtained were:
1) A performance score of 98 and 97 on mobile and desktop
2) An accessibility score of 100 on both
3) Having a responsive nav menu with CSS

Extra Personal Challenges:
1) Created a Japanese version of the site which may need some more updates (including creating a link to switch between the two pages). It has a performance score of 99 and 100 and an accessibility score of 100
2) Created a back to top button that appears as the page scrolls down a bit (which may also allow for the hide/show div requirement to be met)
